# = Cobbler and Puppet for nodes
#
# == Example
#
# add this to your site.pp file:
# import "cobbler-node"
# And an NTP nodes class that can be used in other descriptions.  This updates the 
# even the proxy address
# If you are not using UCS blades, don't worry about the org-EXAMPLE, and if you are
# and aren't using an organization domain, just leave the value as ""
# You can create your own password rather than the one below (which is "ubuntu") by 
# running the following at the command prompt: printf "r00tme" | mkpasswd -s -m md5
# This password is used by the cobbler preseed file to set up the default admin user "localadmin".
# More info is available here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/preseed-contents.html

# If you use them, end each continued line with a \, separate commands with ;
# The last command should not have any additional termination

# preceed the command with 'env -u http_proxy -u https_proxy ' as in:
# in-target env -u http_proxy -u https_proxy wget -O /home/user/file http://${fileserver}:${fileserver_port}/${filename}
