# Cisco OpenStack Edition copy.  This is a workaround.
#
# the Ubuntu cobbler package doesn't ship the logrotate config that is in upstream
# cobbler, so this is *our* copy of it.  Can remove when updating to a Ubuntu cobbler
# that is actually packaged with a logrotate config, or using the EPEL/Fedora cobbler
# which has always had it.
